## 📌 Project: Hotel Reservation Cancellation Analysis (Excel)

---

## 🔹 Short Project Description

Analyzed hotel reservation data using Microsoft Excel to understand booking cancellation patterns and evaluate a logistic regression–based prediction approach. The project focused on working with separate training and testing datasets, feature encoding, performance metrics, and result interpretation using Excel.

---

## 🔹 Project Purpose

The main purpose of this project was to **strengthen analytical thinking and modeling concepts** by:

* Working with real-world structured data
* Understanding train vs test datasets
* Applying classification logic using Excel
* Evaluating prediction performance using business-friendly metrics

---

## 🔹 What I Did in This Project

### 🔸 1. Data Exploration & Preparation

* Analyzed training and testing datasets separately
* Calculated cancellation percentages to understand class distribution
* Identified trends across months, pricing, and booking behavior

---

### 🔸 2. Feature Engineering in Excel

* Performed **one-hot encoding manually in Excel** for:

  * Room type (with a reference category)
  * Arrival month (January as the baseline)
* Structured the data to support classification modeling

---

### 🔸 3. Logistic Regression Modeling (Excel-Based)

* Used Excel to implement and analyze a **logistic regression model**
* Established **baseline accuracy** using majority-class prediction
* Compared model accuracy against baseline to validate improvement

---

### 🔸 4. Model Evaluation

Evaluated model performance using Excel calculations for:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall (True Positive Rate)
* F1 Score
* False Positive Rate

Observed **consistent performance** across training and testing datasets.

---

### 🔸 5. Result Interpretation & Visualization

* Interpreted regression coefficients to explain:

  * Impact of lead time on cancellations
  * Seasonal influence of arrival months
* Created charts and ROC curves in Excel to visualize performance

---

## 🔹 Key Outcomes

* Gained hands-on experience applying predictive modeling concepts using Excel
* Improved understanding of classification metrics and model evaluation
* Learned how to interpret logistic regression outputs in a business context
* Strengthened analytical skills without relying on programming tools
